# Dynamic Pinhole Camera system
using Python :snake:

## Description

This Code written in Python is an implementation of the Pinhole Camera System. Traditional Image Processing literatures show how an image will look like when projected through a Pinhole camera. What sets this repo and the code apart is its implementation of the same Pinhole camera system, but one will be able to see dynamically how the orientation and size of the image changes first with the position of the object, with respet to the pinhole, second with the position of the pinhole, with respect to the screen.

## [ The full mathematics of the Code and the Dynamic Pinhole System will be published shortly ]
Though the whole code is fully functional. But improved versions of the code will be committed later.
